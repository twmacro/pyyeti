0. Add generic assemble array routine ? (a, b, …, c, ‘’, A, B, …C, ‘’, …)
1. Update duf explanation in cla.apply_uf
3. Rearrange code: op2, op4, n2p, nastran overlap ... ?
   - primarly rdnas2cam ... seems like this should be in n2p
4. Convert uset to dataframe i think
5. Convert ext, mx, mn in DR_Results to dataframe
10.1. What about function for splitting SimpleNamespace results into
    sub-categories:
    - if the "Liftoff" event has 4 sub-cases:
        res.cases = ['case1', 'case2', 'case3', 'case4']
      then the new DR_Results would be
        res['case1'].cases = ['case1']
        res['case2'].cases = ['case2']
        res['case3'].cases = ['case3']
        res['case4'].cases = ['case4']
    - this would:
       - allow easy comparison of a specific sub-case to another 
       - enable any function that uses .ext to work on a sub-case

12. op4: add some c?
15. cla.py:
    DR_Results() … should this be able to init? I think so:
                   DR_Results(drdefs, mission, event)
                   … similar to DR.prepare_results(mission, event)
                   … and/or, what about a DR_Def.prepare_results()
    ß actually, replace DR_Event.prepare_results() I think!!
                   Get rid of Info in DR_Event? Probably can’t because
                   of the uf_reds override.

    Naming convention should be more consistent:
      drdefs vs. Info vs. drminfo
         - Could they all be DR_Def instances??

         - Info can be a DR_Def instance ... but each drminfo is just
           a SimpleNamespace: a "value" in the DR_Def (or Info) dict

    - think about getting rid of DR_Event altogether ... just update
      a new DR_Def with all drdefs/dufs/ulvs's ... will this work?

    Be sure to update doctest for add_maxmin

    ~ DR_Def could be derived from dict or OrderedDict …
    “drdefs[cat]” seems better than “drdefs.dr_def[cat]”

    ~ Hmm … what about "class DR_Event(dict)"?
                   Nah, this one seems okay as is

    Update the code to better handle NaNs.
      - got a couple different methods going right now ... ??


~    1 resp_plots pdf filename -- this is the `onepdf` option i believe
    2 write complete test_cla.py
    3 magpct needs to be able to chop off small numbers

    4 when flagging, but no flags, format is shortened by one char for that column
    5 maybe add option to use only one figure ... that should be default ?

    6 y-axis label written far away in srs3/net_ifatm_0rb_eqsine_all.pdf plot ... why?
~    7 include documentation link for "load" and "save"

16. op2 updates:
  - some functions should be "public", like _rdop2nt()
19. Add windowends to srs ?
~20. Change output of fdepsd to DataFrames
