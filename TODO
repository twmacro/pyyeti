0. generic assemble array routine ? (a, b, …, c, ‘’, A, B, …C, ‘’, …)
    - base this off of scipy.linalg.block_diag ... or is there
      something there already?

1. Update duf explanation in cla.apply_uf

5. Convert ext, mx, mn in DR_Results to dataframe

6. rddmig needs profiling / updating for very large DMIGs

7. add wtdmig
   - add tests
   - beta in 0.93.6

12. op4: add some c?

15. cla.py:
    DR_Results() … should this be able to init? I think so:
                   DR_Results(drdefs, mission, event)
                   … similar to DR.prepare_results(mission, event)
                   … and/or, what about a DR_Def.prepare_results()
    - actually, replace DR_Event.prepare_results() I think
                   Get rid of Info in DR_Event? Probably can’t because
                   of the uf_reds override.

    Naming convention should be more consistent:
      drdefs vs. Info vs. drminfo
         - Could they all be DR_Def instances??

         - Info can be a DR_Def instance ... but each drminfo is just
           a SimpleNamespace: a "value" in the DR_Def (or Info) dict

    - think about getting rid of DR_Event altogether ... just update
      a new DR_Def with all drdefs/dufs/ulvs's ... will this work?
      - i don't think so

    Update the code to better handle NaNs.
      - got a couple different methods going right now ... ??

    2 write complete test_cla.py
    4 when flagging, but no flags, format is shortened by one char for that column
    5 maybe add option to use only one figure ... that should be default ?
    6 y-axis label written far away in srs3/net_ifatm_0rb_eqsine_all.pdf plot ... why?
    8 Save eqsine to xlsx file

19. Add windowends to srs ?

21. In cb or cla:
    - make routine that returns string for adding data recovery
      categories for mk_net_drms output:
"""
        @cla.DR_Def.addcat
        def _():
            name = 'net_ifatm'
            ...
        ...
        """
        o   Could accept s/c name for description strings
        o   Or, make this just a function call? … that actually runs it?
            §  Would need defaults and maybe other inputs
            §  Could have it call mk_net_drms internally


23. ? Add option to change time step during simulation
    o   Save parameters in dictionary for each time step?
    o   Or, are the params cheap to recompute?
    Hmm ... would have to decide how to save results (even time steps?)


31. frf_apply_duf – see if needed and consider renaming (psd_apply_duf?)

32. cla:
    - Maybe should have capability to create null (zeros) category
      (with srs’s) … or just make sure zero case is accounted for in
      combination … hmm.

    - Form_extreme
       - Skip some events? (Like static and random, but include total)

34. cb: Teach cbtf to handle 0 frequency case like solveunc.fsolve
    does.

36. cbreorder could take tuple of matrices ...

38. test_ntfl_rbdamping: figure this out:
    pre_eig = True doesn't work ... not sure why at the
    moment (maybe conflict with rb modes setting)

39. DR.add – should check for drms and nondrms … ?
    -  What about an easier way to just proceed without nas
       (if None, more actively make do without it … with
       warning maybe?)

43. Bref – what about a model with mechanisms?
    - let bref not be a mult of 6?

48. add sparse Newmark solver

52. In rdpostop2, matrix names should probably be lower case.

53. Enhance the ‘seconct’ output (include ‘up’, ‘down’? … this is only down (I think)):

   p = op2.rdpostop2(sys_op2 + '.op2')
   seconct = {}
   j = 0
   for ind in (p['seconct'] == -1).nonzero()[0][::2]:
       seconct[p['seconct'][j]] = p['seconct'][j+8:ind][::2]
       j = ind + 2

   {101: array([     91,      92,      93, ..., 5907498, 5907499, 5907500], dtype=int32),
   102: array([1290001, 1290002, 1290003, ..., 1710100, 1710101, 1710102], dtype=int32),
   201: array([2000004, 2005283, 2005319, ..., 5924498, 5924499, 5924500], dtype=int32),
   609: array([7999031, 7999032, 7999033, ..., 9004098, 9004099, 9004100], dtype=int32)}

~ 58. Order of recovery should be maintained from definition order
     o   I think the only change (besides documenting that order is
         used) is to change this from:
            self.Info = {}
     o   To:
            self.Info = OrderedDict()
     o   In DR_Event.__init__

59. For 58 to be really useful, probably need to enhance
    calls to the drfuncs … would want access to other categories.
    Need some good ideas for this.
     o   Pass in the parent DR_Results … ?

     o Update drfunc arg list to enhance functionality:
    - now: drfunc(sol, nas, Vars, se)
    - new, after discussion with BTA:
      drfunc(sol, se_vars, event_data, user_arg) ... or something
      - event_data is a dict with potentially:
         - parent DR_Results
         - name
         - se
         - drmres SimpleNamespace
         - number of cases
         - current case
         - ? freq for psd functions?
         - nas

63. mk_net_drms: output coord system could be input ...
    think of multiple ports

    - Having this internal would help because cglf could be formed
      in proper local coord system

    - actually, cglf is junk anyway isn't it? It would be computing
      based on the structure with the ports ... not the item attached
      to the port

    - but, ifatm and ifltm for the port would be nice ... probably

    ~ - ALSO: have it be able to output "g, rad/sec^2", "g, g/in", and
      "in/sec^2, rad/sec^2"
        v0.95.0

66. Write a nastran coordinate system plotter
    - use pyNastran instead?

67. Write a nastran node plotter
    - use pyNastran instead?

68. Add extreme histories to cla.DR_Results.form_extreme

69. Find or write a replacement for "mkruns"
    - Britney has something maybe for this ... ?

71. Implement compmat i think

73. Check into subspace iteration logic
    - Bathe K.J. The subspace iteration method – Revisited.
      Comput Struct (2012),
      http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruc.2012.06.002

    - https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/PDF/ys-2014-1.pdf

74. Implement ERA algorithm

``75. Check out coverage for parallel processing
    o   Also, those if’s without an else … ? “Branch” testing.
    - unsuccessful on first attempt ... worth it?

76. Check manifest app

77. Accommodate ulvs, mugf and nothing … via a tag?
    - What about ‘drms’ and ‘nondrms’?
    - idea: instead of 'drms' and 'nondrms', use categories that
      specify which transform is to be used:
       - 'modes' (or 'phi' or 'ulvs' or ?)
       - 'resflex' (or 'g' or 'rf' or 'mugf' or ?)
       - 'none' (or 'other' or 'misc' or 'data' or ?)
    - from discussion with BTA, think about using, for example:
         acce = ltma
         velo = ltmv
         disp = ltmd
         forc = ltmf
       - probably wouldn't need to define a drfunc in this case!

~83. rddmig reads upper case names for op2, lower for pch?
    - v0.96.0


84. if licensing is good, update guitools to Qt ... I think (this was
    nearly done i think ... just never finalized it because of license
    (see ~/python/gui/guitools_qt.py))

85. update the numpy docstring output to be current (right now, still
    using v 1.13)

87. Add "addcat" skeleton code generator?
    - goal is to make adding data recovery categories simpler

97. Add the “tf” class somewhere. Maybe ...
      o   After add “pade” …

98. datacursor.DC
    - add highlight_line option? Line would be plotted in a
      specifiable style when clicked (or hovered on?)
      o   Hmm, probably any time an annotation would be drawn
      o   Ability to turn off annotation might then be a desirable
          option

99. Add generator feature and hm features to Newmark-Beta solver

~100. Add the Chapman solver (or similar) with the generator & hm
     features
     - added in version 0.94.6
     - need to add tests for new solver!
     - add as SolveCDF in 0.94.7

~101. Add regex to nastran.rdcards …
     ‘DTI     SELOAD’ would be better as ‘DTI\s+SELOAD’
     - done in version 0.95.0

102. Fix up the sparse documentation for wtextseout

~ 103. Add units option to mk_net_drms:
     o   G, rad/sec^2
     o   G, G/in
     o   In/sec^2, rad/sec^2
     - done in version 0.95.0

104. Add 'axis' option fftfilt (and others too probably)
     o make it elegant ... check dsp.exclusive_sgfilter to see if
       that's done well. Numpy must have nice functions for this since
       many of those functions allow it. Share code amongst these
       functions.

~105. Think about refactoring the cd_as_force=True option of SolveUnc
     to its own class ... inheriting from SolveUnc (that way, don’t
     need the non-uniformity of having the cd_as_force option)
       o SolveUncCD? ... And fail when M & K are not diagonal? (nah on
         the fail i think ... just fall back to SolveUnc)
       o Refactoring this seems good for doc purposes
     - done as SolveCDF, v0.94.7

106. Add Henkel-Mar class -- I think. The one in
     python/workworks/henkelmar.py *might* be where to start.

107. Add more tutorials.
     - generator solver
     - force limiting
     - nonlinear spring analysis
     - cla

~108. Fdepsd Di_test – mention it doesn’t include sigma

~109. I think: get rid of hadamard in SolveUnc doc
     - version 0.94.9

110. Consider refactoring the generator solvers by using “yield from”
     (can code be reused?)

`111. Consider refactoring large modules into small files
     o   Approach used in scipy:
         - make ode, cla, ... packages ... just like nastran is now
         - in the ode/__init__.py, imports could be, for example:
              from .solveunc import *
              from .solveexp2 import *
     - ode, cla refactored in v0.95.1

112. Can some things (ode solvers?) be sped up by numba?

~113. Move "finddups" from ode to locate (and rename it to
     'find_duplicates')
     - version 0.94.9

~114. misspelled efficient in ode tutorial
      -fixed in v0.95.1

~115. cla.DR_Results srs plotter: hit the peaks
      -fixed in v0.95.1

~116. From TRU: the 6x6 mass matrix stuff is wrong in pyYeti!
      - fixed in v0.95.1

~117. What to do about this:
     The pandas “to_numpy” was added in version 0.24.0 … hmmm
     - reverted back to .values in v0.95.1

~118. SolveCDF doc updates from BTA:
     - define Qi before using it
     - number equations
     - example uses SolveUnc for plot label
     - fixed in v0.95.1

~119. Mark srs end points in cla.DR_Results.srs_plots
      v0.95.5

~120. In cla.DR_Results.*_plots ... plot legend looks bad unless
     positioned with live plot ???
     - pdfs look good ... not png
     -- apparently, the "bbox_inches='tight'" option was messing
        the plot up ... ?
     v0.95.5

~121. Could mention in relative_displacement_dtm where tug1, mug1
     usually come from ... or maybe that's shown in the example?
     v0.95.5

~122. cla.DR_Def
     - When checking for a data recovery function, second import
       of say "drfuncs.py" (from a different directory) fails
       because the "drfuncs" module was already imported. However,
       the actual importer during data recovery seems to work ....
       Two different import methods?
       v0.95.5

~123. cla.DR_Def
     - Pickle loading not working properly: cannot rely on
       having "drdefaults". For example, the drdefs may have been
       merged from multiple different sets, all with their own
       "drdefaults".
       v0.95.5

124. cla.DR_Def, cla.DR_Results
     - Right now, there is no way to assure or confirm that a "psd"
       version of a data recovery function gets or was used ... hmm

~125. Bulk2uset without grids should work
     - v0.95.9

~126. Both solvepsd routines list “fs” as a class … it’s an instance
     of a class
     o   Both versions: “all of rigid-body is included (see note
         below)”, but there is no note
     - v0.95.9

~127. Rptpct1
     o   Add flag to ignore labels
     o   Use ignore_pv before looking at labels
     - v0.95.9

~128. psd.rescale should pay attention to “frange” even if “freq” is
     input
     - v0.95.9

129. Do the return values of rptpct1 make sense?

~130. In magpct, what about really large values “hiding” small ones?
     - Log-x or linear-log-x?
     - Option to set scale?
     - v0.96.0 -- added "symlogx" and "symlogx_ratio" options

~131. Rddmig and uset tables should have same index label names (‘id’
      vs ‘ID’).
      - v0.96.0

132. Units in mk_net_drms should be more settable (now, translation
     acceleration units is the only option)

~133. Change figures in examples to use "Example" and "Example 2"
      names:

        >>> fig = plt.figure('Example', figsize=(8, 6))
        >>> fig.clf()

134. mk_net_drms:

     ~ - The check below should be against the subset of b, if there
         is one
     - Also, the 123 vs 123456 should be a user option
     - With one grid, if it’s the reference, should we mess with
       formrbe3 at all???

        # use RBE3 for net accelerations
        if len(bset) > 6:
            dof_indep = 123
            xyz = ytools.mkpattvec([0, 1, 2], len(bset_if), 6).ravel()
            xyz = bset_if[xyz]
        else:
            dof_indep = 123456
            xyz = np.arange(6)

     - reorder is not efficient (fix mk_net_drms or cbreorder or
       both??)
        - if no reordering, just do nothing

     - grids should be from full uset … exception can happen otherwise
       because of a repeated grid id during the addgrid (pandas does
       not necessarily create delete old id’s from the index … it just
       doesn’t use them):

         grids = uset_if.index.get_level_values("id")[::6]
         new_id = grids.max() + 1
         uset2 = n2p.addgrid(uset_if, new_id, "b", 0, ref, 0)

~135. nosetests is not running doctests on files like cla/_magpct.py
      v0.96.1 -- added "ignore-files='^$'" to setup.cfg

136. Good solution for addgrid??:
     uset.index = uset.index.remove_unused_levels()

~`137. ode.solveunc – damping can’t be diagonal (maa, kaa were square,
     but … ??)
     - used pre_eig option for CB matrices and wanted static initial
       condition
     - ALSO, in tsolve(s), add note to use pre_eig if needed to get to
       modal space!!
     - i think bug is fixed (0.96.1) but still need to check docs ...
       starting point is last test in test_ode.py
    v0.96.2

138. Switch testing to pytest. nosetests is not maintained apparently.
     - don't import nose for tests
     - this is probably not as big a job as it sounds ... nose tools
       aren't used that heavily I don't think (it's not tiny ...)
