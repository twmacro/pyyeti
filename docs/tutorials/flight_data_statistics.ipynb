    "This notebook compares two methods to compute \"MPE\" (maximum predicted environment) and \"Qual\" levels from simulated flight data. The simulated flight data could be for a shock response spectrum (SRS) level at some frequency. In this notebook, MPE is the \"P95/50\" level and Qual is the \"P99/90\" level. In other words, the MPE level will have a 50% chance of bounding 95% of the population and the Qual level will have a 90% chance of bounding 99% of the population. The first number (95% for example) can be called the normal probability limit, and the second number (50% for example) can be called the confidence level. The equations for both methods are related to each other and are derived below following Owen [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method is to assume that the standard deviation of the population is 3 dB. This has been used in MIL-STD-1540 and is still maintained in \"SMC Standard SMC-S-016\" [2]. It is further supported by Yunis [3]. Method 1 will use the equation:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\bar{x}_g$ is the sample geometric mean (see below), $Z_p$ is the number standard deviations to go from the mean to the normal probability limit, $Z_c$ is the number standard deviations to go from the mean to the confidence level, and $n$ is the number of samples. For a P95/50 level, if $F_N$ is the cumulative distribution function for the normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_p = 0.95$$\n",
    "$$Z_p = F_N^{-1}(P_p) = \\text{scipy.stats.norm.ppf}(P_p) = 1.64$$\n",

    "\n",
    "where $P_p$ is the normal probability level and $P_c$ is the confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method is to use normal tolerance limits to compute the statistical bounds. Specifically, we'll use the function ``pyyeti.stats.ksingle``. We'll show that the two methods can be equivalent if two conditions are met: the simulated flight sample standard deviation is 3 dB (as assumed in the first method), and we have enough flights for an accurate estimate of the standard deviation. We'll also explore what happens for fewer flights. This has been explored previously [3]. Method 2 will use the noncentral *t*-distribution. If $F_T$ is the cumulative distribution function of the noncentral *t*-distribution, then:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So, if $k$ is 2 and $\\sigma$ is 3 dB, then the 2-sigma level is approximately twice the mean. Clearly, this is not a normal distribution where $k \\sigma$ would be *added* to the mean. However, multiplication becomes addition in log space. So, to put in a more standard form, take the logarithm of both sides of the previous equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log_{10}(level) = \\log_{10}(\\mu_g \\cdot 10^{k \\sigma / 20})$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\log_{10}(level) = \\log_{10}(\\mu_g) + k \\sigma_{log_{10}}$$\n",

    "Therefore, the standard deviation of the log10 of the data ($\\sigma_{log_{10}}$) is related to standard deviation in dB ($\\sigma$) by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_{log_{10}} = \\sigma / 20$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: the natural logarithm could have been used as well. In that case: $\\sigma_{log_e} = \\sigma / 20 \\log_e(10)$. This fact will be used below to generate log-normal random deviates with ``scipy.stats.lognorm.rvs``.)\n",

The mean of the estimate and the standard deviation of the estimate are stored in the DataFrame for plotting the results with error bars (in steps 5 and 6). The error bars will show the standard deviation of the estimate: large error bars indicate that more samples may be needed. For example, if there are 1000 simulations to compute the MPE level, the bar height is set to the mean of the 1000 estimates, and the error bars are set to the standard deviation of the 1000 estimates.\n",

    "When using normal tolerance limits (NTL), there is a lot less variation in the results when estimating the mean or MPE levels than there is when estimating the Qual level. In other words, it takes significantly more samples to accurately estimate the Qual level than the MPE or mean levels. This shouldn't be too surprising: the Qual level is in the thinner part of the tail where data is naturally harder to come by. Requiring 90% confidence (meaning the estimate will be high 90% of the time) in this region has a large impact on the k-factor. For example, consider the extreme case of just two samples:\n",

    "| P95/90 | 13.09 |\n",
    "| P99/90 | 18.50 |\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above results, 2 flights seemed sufficient to get a reasonable estimate of the mean. For MPE, even if the standard deviation is as high as 3 dB, 5 flights was enough to bring the average estimate to within 5%. For Qual however, with a standard deviation of 3 dB, 9 flights only brought the average estimate to within about 60%. From other runs, it took approximately 20 flights to get within 25% (on average). If the standard deviation was 1.5 dB, 9 flights brought the average Qual estimate to within 25%.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to look at the rate of improvement by adding samples. From the Qual plots and tables shown above, it is clear that adding a sample when there are very few samples helps significantly. However, the rate of improvement drops off quickly: the major gains by adding one sample have already taken place by ~6 samples for 1.5 dB and by ~9 samples for 3.0 dB. After that, significant gains require more and more samples. Here is a plot showing this:"
